# portable npp markdown

## portable npp
- download latest npp in 7z from [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.1.html)
- extract it to your portable folder, such as C:\portableapps\npp.

## markdown syntax highlight 
By default there is not markdown syntax highlight in npp, Thanks Edditoria shared few dark themes [here](https://github.com/Edditoria/markdown-plus-plus).

I prefer Bespin dark theme for npp so changed little bit, and share [here](https://github.com/robertluwang/npp/blob/master/markdown/userDefineLang-markdown-bespin.xml)  .

You can import it to npp from top menu Language->Define your language->import, restart npp will see Markdown(Bespin) in list.

## markdown preview
I used MarkdownViewer++ plugin, you can install it from Plugin Manager.

Here is screen shot.
