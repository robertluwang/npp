## npp dark theme
Notepad++ has very good theme/style design tool - Style Configurator, you can highly customize style based on predefined theme. 

## how to customize npp theme
I prefer Bespin dark theme however not happy with existing styles, cannot tolerate the light green, pink, black text on dark background, so manually adjust them in Style Configurator,it will update npp\themes\Bespin.xml directly.

I saved it [here](https://github.com/robertluwang/npp/blob/master/Bespin.xml), in case you want to have a try, or quickly recover the prefer dark theme to new npp installation, just replace Bespin.xml in npp\themes.
